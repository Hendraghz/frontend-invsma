              Sharia shares are shares issued by a company (Issuer) and in
              accordance with Islamic sharia principles. In this context, sharia
              means that investing in such stocks does not involve elements that
              are prohibited in Islam, such as riba (interest), gharar
              (uncertainty), and haram (prohibited activities or goods).
